# Institutional Slides in [MARP](https://marp.app/)

A few days ago I discovered this powerful tool called [MARP](https://marp.app/) (*Markdown Presentation Ecosystem*) and it's pretty what it can produce.

So, I decided take the backgrounds that my university uses for our presentations and make some adaptations to the slides to fit with the changes.

These slides are made specially for the University of Guanauato but the slides layout can be implemented in any other slide deck you create.
